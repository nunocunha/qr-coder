# QR coder
QR coder is a browser extension that encodes text selection and URLs into QR codes. Simple to use: right-click, click, done.

## Features
- Create QR codes with 2 clicks
- Same page code generation (don't have to leave the current webpage)
- Local code generation (information never leaves your computer)

## Instructions
The addon has 2 methods of operation:

1. Select text and right-click to generate a code from that text.
2. Just right-click anywhere (image, video, link, the page itself, etc.) to generate a code with its URL.

After the QR code is presented, click outside of its box to close it.

## Downloads
- Firefox
  - Head over to [AMO]() and install it as usual.

- Chrome and Edge
  - Download the repository and extract it to a folder, then use the browser's mechanisms to sideload it.
